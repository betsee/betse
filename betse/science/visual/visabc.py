# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: Visuals currently exhibit extremely non-ideal behaviour, including:
#
#* Repeated display of OS-level notifications resembling '"Figure 1" is ready'.
#* Continually bringing the window containing the most recently created plot or
#  animation frame to the front of the window stack, which then forcefully
#  steals the keyboard focus.
#
#Altogether, these issues effectively render interactive plotting unusable.
#Fortunately, the following StackOverflow post appears to have sufficiently
#resolved this issue for relatively recent versions of Matplotlib:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/a/55456635/2809027
#Likewise, note the related discussion at the close of this issue thread:
#    https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/596
#
#The core issue appears to be our use of the pyplot.pause() function, which we
#will now need to globally replace across the entire codebase with calls to
#fig.canvas.draw_idle() and fig.canvas.start_event_loop(0.001) instead.
#FIXME: Actually, visuals now appear to be behave as expected again -- under
#matplotlib >= 3.10.0 and Arch Linux + Wayland, anyway. Let's choose to
#conveniently ignore this probably non-issue for the moment, please. \o/

#FIXME: Refactor all procedural cell cluster-specific
#"betse.science.visual.plot.plotutil" functions into subclasses of the
#"LayerCellsABC" base class defined elsewhere. Ultimate power fights the dark
#deceit!

class VisualCellsABC(object, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    '''
    Abstract base class of all **cell cluster visual** (i.e., plot or animation
    spatially visualizing the current cell cluster) subclasses.

    Subclasses of this class plot the spatial distribution of one or more
    modelled variables (e.g., charge distribution, membrane voltage) for
    either:

    * A single simulation time step, in which this subclass plots a still frame
      of these variables for this step.
    * One or more simulation time steps, in which this subclass animates a
      video of these variables for these steps.

    Attributes (Private)
    ----------
    _conf : SimConfVisualCellsABC
        Configuration for this visual, synchronized with the user-defined
        YAML-backed simulation configuration file for this phase.
    _kind : str
        Basename of the subdirectory in the phase-specific results directory
        to which all files exported for this visual are saved *and*
        the basename prefix of these files.
    _layers : list
        List of all :class:`LayerCellsABC` instances collectively composing
        this visual.
    _phase : SimPhase
        Current simulation phase.

    Attributes (Private: Figure)
    ----------
    _figure : Figure
        Matplotlib figure providing the current animation frame.
    _figure_title : str
        Text displayed above the figure itself.

    Attributes (Private: Axes)
    ----------
    _axes : Axes
        Matplotlib figure axes providing the current animation frame data.
    _axes_title : str
        Text displayed above the figure axes. If a non-``None`` value for the
        ``axes_title`` parameter is passed to the :meth:`__init__` method, this
        is that value; else, this is the value of the ``figure_title``
        parameter passed to that method.
    _axes_x_label : str
        Text displayed below the figure's X axis.
    _axes_y_label : str
        Text displayed to the left of the figure's Y axis.

    Attributes (Private: Color)
    ----------
    _color_mappables : IterableTypes
        Iterable of all plotted mappables (i.e., instances of the
        :class:`ScalarMappable` class added to the figure axes of this plot or
        animation) whose minimum and maximum values define the color range
        displayed both in the figure axes and colorbar of this plot or
        animation. Due to matplotlib constraints, only the first mappable in
        this iterable is associated with this colorbar.
    _colorbar_title: StrOrNoneTypes
        Text displayed above the figure colorbar if any *or* ``None``
        otherwise.
    _color_max : NumericSimpleTypes
        Maximum color value to be displayed by the colorbar.
    _color_min : NumericSimpleTypes
        Minimum color value to be displayed by the colorbar.
    _colormap : Colormap
        Matplotlib colormap with which to create this animation's colorbar.

    Attributes (Private: Saving)
    ----------
    _writer_savefig_kwargs : dict
        Dictionary of all keyword arguments to be passed to the
        :meth:`Figure.savefig` method called to save each visual frame for
        both still images and animated video. By default, this dictionary:

        * Enables the ``transparent`` argument, painting frame backgrounds
          transparently rather than as a solid color (usually, white).

    Attributes (Private: Time)
    ----------
    _is_time_step_first : bool
        ``True`` only if the first frame either has yet to be plotter *or* is
        currently being plotted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        phase : SimPhase
            Current simulation phase.
        conf : SimConfVisualCellsABC
            Configuration for this visual, synchronized with the user-defined
            YAML-backed simulation configuration file for this phase.
        is_save : bool
            ``True`` only if non-interactively saving this visual.
        is_show : bool
            ``True`` only if interactively displaying this visual.
        kind : str
            Terse machine-readable string (e.g., ``Vmem``) serving as both:

            * The basename of the subdirectory of the phase-specific results
              directory containing all files saved by this visual.
            * The basename prefix of these files.
        figure_title : str
            Text displayed above the figure itself.
        axes_title : optional[str]
            Text displayed above the figure axes but below the figure title.
            Defaults to `None`, in which case no such text is displayed.
        axes_x_label : optional[str]
            Text displayed below this figure's X axis. Defaults to ``None``, in
            which case a general-purpose string is defaulted to.
        axes_y_label : optional[str]
            Text displayed to the left of this figure's Y axis. Defaults to
            ``None``, in which case a general-purpose string is defaulted to.
        colorbar_title: optional[str]
            Text displayed above the figure colorbar if any *or* ``None``
            otherwise. If this parameter is ``None`` *and* at least one layer
            in the passed ``layers`` parameter is an instance of the
            :class:`LayerCellsColorfulABC` base class, an exception is raised.
        colormap : optional[Colormap]
            Matplotlib colormap to be used by default for all animation artists
            (e.g., colorbar, images). Defaults to ``None``, in which case the
            default colormap is used.
        layers : optional[SequenceTypes]
            Sequence of all :class:`LayerCellsABC` instances collectively
            plotting each frame of this visual. **Order is extremely
            significant.** Specifically, the order of layers in this sequence
            defines the order in which these layers are plotted and hence
            overlaid onto one another (i.e., z-order). Defaults to `None`, in
            which case the subclass is responsible for manually plotting this
            visual.

        * As the last action of either:

          * The current caller.
          * The visual subclass.

        Attempting to subsequently call any other method *or* access any other
        variable bound to this object will reliably raise an exception.

        #
        # * The current platform is Windows, whose POSIX-incompatible process
        #   model has special needs.
        # * The current visual is non-blocking *AND* the current
        #   backend is poorly implemented or supported (e.g., "Qt4Agg").
        #
        # Since reliably detecting all such conditions is non-trivial and
        # certainly more time consuming than unconditionally yielding the time
        # slice for a negligible amount of time, we prefer the latter approach.
        #
        # In theory, the time slice should *NEVER* need to be manually yielded.
        # The "matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation" class should handle such
        # low-level details, as confirmed by the pyplot.pause() docstring:
        #
        #  pause(interval)
        #
        #     Pause for *interval* seconds.
        #
        #     If there is an active figure it will be updated and displayed,
        #     and the gui event loop will run during the pause.
        #
        #     If there is no active figure, or if a non-interactive backend
        #     is in use, this executes time.sleep(interval).
        #
        #     This can be used for crude animation. For more complex
        #     animation, see :mod:`matplotlib.animation`.
        #
        # Note the last paragraph, implying the low-level pyplot.pause() method
        # to be an alternative (rather than addition) to the the higher-level
        # "matplotlib.animation" submodule. Unfortunately, this does *NOT*
        # appear to be the case; the pyplot.pause() method *MUST* be manually
        # called even when leveraging "matplotlib.animation" functionality.

        --------
        TriMesh
            Mesh plot produced by plotting the passed cell data.
