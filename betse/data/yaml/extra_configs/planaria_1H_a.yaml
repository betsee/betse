# WORLD OPTIONS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The 'world' refers to cell geometric properties, the size of the cluster, and the properties of the environment,
# such as size and temperature. These variables are common to both init and sim runs. All of these world variables
# will be created in the init and apply to all sims running from the init.

# File sync warning: you can't change any of these 'world options' after running 'betse seed'.

  world size: 400e-6      # dimension of the square world space [m]
                          # the world is square with x = y.

# TISSUE PROFILE DESIGNATION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tissue profiles are user-defined regions within the cluster to which specific base membrane diffusion profiles,
# interventions, and individualized dynamics (e.g voltage gated channels) can be applied.
# Tissue profiles can be gap-junction connected or separated (isolated) from other tissue profiles.
# Cluster shape and individual tissues can be defined by bitmaps, or specified via various functional regimes.
# When multiple profiles apply to the same cell, options defined by later profiles override options defined by
# earlier profiles.

# A profile's functionality is defined by the value of its "type" key:
#
# -> "type: tissue" associates profiled cells with the same parameters and events.
# -> "type: cut" permanently removes all cells at the begining of a sim run.
#                Cut profiles are ignored unless the cutting event defined below is also enabled.
#
# No File synch issues: Tissue profiles can be altered after the time of the 'betse seed' command.

# match to the target Vmem and initial concentrations listed for the "custom biomolecules" section of the network.

general network:
