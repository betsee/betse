    ``True`` only if the **recursive mtime** (i.e., recursively calculated

    For efficiency, this function short-circuits at the first path in this
    iterable newer than than this path. Callers are thus recommended to pass an
    iterable pre-sorted such that:

    * Non-directory files (whose recursive mtime reduces to an efficient
      constant-time operation) are ordered *before* directories (whose recursive
      mtime requires performing an inefficient filesystem walk).
    * Directories expected to contain fewer files and subdirectories are ordered
      *before* directories expected to contain more files and subdirectories.

    This function is functionally equivalent to (but substantially faster in
    both the worst and common case than) the following conditional logic:

       get_mtime_recursive(pathname) < get_mtime_recursive_newest(pathnames)

    If this path is:

    * A directory, this is the most recent time at which the non-recursive
      contents of this directory were created, modified, or deleted. Since this

    * A symbolic link, this is the most recent time at which this symbolic link

    This function moves this source path in a manner that maximally preserves

        Absolute or relative pathname of the source path to be copied from.
    trg_pathname: str
        Absolute or relative pathname of the target path to be copied to.

    Raises
