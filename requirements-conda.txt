# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# List of all mandatory or optional runtime dependencies of this application to
# be installed by the "conda" package manager bundled with both the default
# Anaconda distribution and minimal Miniconda distribution.
#
# This file conforms to the "conda"- rather than "setuptools"- or "pip"-specific
# file format for dependencies. Hence, the existing dependencies listed by the
# top-level "setup.py" script *CANNOT* be reused here by merely specifying ".".
#
# --------------------( EXAMPLES                           )--------------------
# To generate a sample file in this format describing all currently installed
# "conda" packages, run the following command:
#
#     $ conda list -e

# ....................{ DEPENDENCIES ~ mandatory           }....................
# All mandatory runtime dependencies of this application, manually converted from
# the "betse.metadata.DEPENDENCIES_RUNTIME_MANDATORY" global.
setuptools
numpy
pyyaml
scipy
dill
matplotlib
pillow
six

# All mandatory test dependencies of this application, manually converted from
# the "betse.metadata.DEPENDENCIES_TESTTIME_MANDATORY" global.
pytest 

# ....................{ DEPENDENCIES ~ optional            }....................
# All optional runtime dependencies of this application, manually converted from
# the "betse.metadata.DEPENDENCIES_RUNTIME_OPTIONAL" global.

#FIXME: Unfortunately, networkx 1.10 is unavailable under Python 3.5 under
#Anaconda. Until networkx 1.12 is both released and made available under
#Anaconda, networkx is currently ignored. Since pydot is ignored without
#networkx, pydot is necessarily ignored as well.

#networkx
#pydot

#FIXME: The following packages are unavailable via default "linux-64" channels.
#Consider grepping about for alternate third-party channels.

#pprofile
#ptpython
